# Hi!

- Hi. I'm Samuel Mullen and I'm going to be talking to you today about Test
  Driven Development, or TDD
- Background
- I've been writing software for about 20 years
- About half of that I've been practicing TDD
- I tell you this only to let you know 
- 1. I know what it's like to develop w/o it
- 2. I know what it's like to develop w/ it
- In then next 30-45 minutes, we're going to...
- 1. Get an overview of both TDD and non-tdd development processes
- 2. See where they're similar and where they differ
- 3. See how not using TDD is making your programming life 
- 4. Look at the benefts of TDD
- 5. How to get started with TDD
- ...but to get going, let's look at some lies about TDD

---

# Lies, *Damned Lies*, and **TDD**

---

# Lies *About* TDD

* It takes longer to code w/ TDD than without
* Twice the code means twice the maintenance
* TDD only works on small projects
* Our project is different

^
- TDD increases initial dev time by 10-30%. 
- It reduces bugs in production by 40-80%
- Ruby on Rails, Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System, Windows 7
- Lest anyone think I'm unfair

---

# Lies *for* TDD

* No longer a need for architecture and design
* Your code will be cleaner
* TDD Means Bug-Free code

^
- People are always trying to get out of thinking. TDD won't help you there.
- TDD certainly helps fight complexity, but there are a lot of developers whose
  comfort zone is complexity
- Yeah....

R Jeffries and G Melnik, writing for IEE have reported that TDD helps in decreasing production bugs by 40-80%. Of course, it can add 10-30% to the initial development time and cost but considering the factors like defect fixes, and maintenance it is justified to implement TDD for the first phase of project development. In fact, the benefits of TDD have been tested on real projects by several companies and they found that the process is enormously beneficial.

# Getting Started

* It doesn't click the first time you try it

Other Things
------------

* Mention that when I take on new projects I always ask if there are tests
  - Helps me figure out if things are going to work
  - Helps me determine estimates
  - It tells me how hard it's going to be to upgrade/refactor
